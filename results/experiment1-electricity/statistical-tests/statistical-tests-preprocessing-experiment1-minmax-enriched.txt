PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 15, p-value = 0.02953
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 79.1954
90 percent confidence interval:
 80.5636     Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      82.13273 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 78.3788
90 percent confidence interval:
 75.4811     Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      76.03389 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)

90 percent confidence interval:
 70.8664     Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      72.32961 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected
