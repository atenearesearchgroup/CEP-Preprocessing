PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 11, p-value = 0.2092
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 81.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 80.8  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      84.84998 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9849
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 82.5
95 percent confidence interval:
 78.7  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      80.04999 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
