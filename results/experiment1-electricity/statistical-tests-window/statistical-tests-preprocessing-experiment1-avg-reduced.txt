PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9849
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 81.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 67.2  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      68.10004 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845

90 percent confidence interval:
 71.89996      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      72.74998 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected
