PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 81.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 64.39997      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      68.29994 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 82.5
90 percent confidence interval:
 71.59999      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      71.90004 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
