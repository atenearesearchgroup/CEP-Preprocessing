PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 14, p-value = 0.05282
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 81.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 82.89999      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      85.79996 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9849
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 82.5
95 percent confidence interval:
 76.5  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      78.39994 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]

90 percent confidence interval:
 73.14993      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      75.60006 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
