PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 79.1954
90 percent confidence interval:
 63.85057      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      65.41425 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]

90 percent confidence interval:
 71.12904      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      71.36305 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected
