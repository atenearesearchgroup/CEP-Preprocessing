PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 15, p-value = 0.02953
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 65.0784
90 percent confidence interval:
 65.56982      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
       67.5538 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)

 63.98476      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      65.00621 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected
