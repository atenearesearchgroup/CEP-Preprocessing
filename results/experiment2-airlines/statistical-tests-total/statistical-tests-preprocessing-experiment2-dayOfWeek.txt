PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 3, p-value = 0.9112
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 65.0784
90 percent confidence interval:
 61.6777     Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      62.25665 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 67.1536
90 percent confidence interval:
 59.46531      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      59.62358 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]

 60.82819      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      61.58995 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
