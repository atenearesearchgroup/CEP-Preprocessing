PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 12, p-value = 0.1404
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 65.0784
90 percent confidence interval:
 64.25246      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      76.42015 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 10, p-value = 0.2948
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 67.1536
90 percent confidence interval:
 61.51856      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      72.57436 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
