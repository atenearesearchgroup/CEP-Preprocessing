PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 14, p-value = 0.05282
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64
90 percent confidence interval:
 68.19997      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      81.49991 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 12, p-value = 0.1404
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 64.19997      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      75.09996 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 10, p-value = 0.2948

90 percent confidence interval:
 55.79999      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
          65.5 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
