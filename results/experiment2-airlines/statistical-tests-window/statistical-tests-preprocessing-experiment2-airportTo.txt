PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 12, p-value = 0.1404
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64
90 percent confidence interval:
 60.9  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      76.89991 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 12, p-value = 0.1404

90 percent confidence interval:
 61.59993      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
          77.7 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]

90 percent confidence interval:
 57.39996      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
          70.7 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
