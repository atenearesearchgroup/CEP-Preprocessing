PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 7, p-value = 0.6063
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64
90 percent confidence interval:
 59.34993      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      63.29994 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 5, p-value = 0.7908
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 61.75   Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      63.24999 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 5, p-value = 0.7908

90 percent confidence interval:
 50.09995      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      58.10006 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 15, p-value = 0.02953

90 percent confidence interval:
 55.64998      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      58.50001 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)
