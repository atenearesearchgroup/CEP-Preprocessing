PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 1, p-value = 0.9705
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64
90 percent confidence interval:
 56.54999      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      59.19994 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64.6
90 percent confidence interval:
 57.39996      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      58.39999 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]

alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 63.9
90 percent confidence interval:
 46.2  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
       52.9499 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 15, p-value = 0.02953

90 percent confidence interval:
 53.79997      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      56.10002 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)


LB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)
