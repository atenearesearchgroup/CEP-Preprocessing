PAIRWISE COMPARISON (WILCOXON)
HT : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 6, p-value = 0.7052
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64
90 percent confidence interval:
 62.69994      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
         63.55 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


KNN : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 5, p-value = 0.7918
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 64.6
95 percent confidence interval:
 61.7  Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      62.84999 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


NB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 0, p-value = 0.9845
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 63.9
90 percent confidence interval:
 60.94998      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      61.69994 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected


RC : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)


	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  data[, i]
V = 15, p-value = 0.02953

90 percent confidence interval:
 53.89999      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      56.55006 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)


LB : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)

 60.95994      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      62.60998 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis can be rejected (0.0295291145452684<0.05)


ARF : preprocessing vs no preprocessing (alpha=0.05)

data:  data[, i]
V = 8, p-value = 0.5
alternative hypothesis: true location is greater than 62.28
90 percent confidence interval:
 60.31997      Inf
sample estimates:
(pseudo)median 
      63.09998 

INTERPRETATION: The Null hypothesis cannot be rejected
